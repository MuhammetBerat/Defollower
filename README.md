Defollower
=================

Defollower is the list of the tweeps you follow that have not said anything in at least 30 days. Why does that matter? To some it may not. To others, Twitter is an peer based ecosystem in which we rely on our relationships to lead us to new ones. Recommendation engines may peer into our following lists and use that data to recommend that others follow the same users that we are already following. Imagine the confusion when a recommended followee appears that hasn't uttered a character, let alone 140, in months.

This is one of those projects that just took up web server space for the last year, so that means it wanted to be cleaned up a tiny bit and then published so that it can go back to hibernation. And now it can hibernate anywhere!

**Note** This was never updated to the newer version of Twitter's API, so is probably broken.

Requirements
-------------------

+ Meh.. anything with a web server and PHP should do. Does require sessions, so that could cause some issues if your server doesn't like them.
Configuration / Installation
----------------------------------

+ You'll need to make a **config.php** file based on config.sample.php in includes
+ This will involve creating an app at http://dev.twitter.com and filling in the values
+ Also you need a URL

Live Example
---------------

A live example of Defollower was at `http://defollower.com`, but is no longer.
